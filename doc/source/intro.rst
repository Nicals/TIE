What is TIE ?
-------------

The tie library provides a set of classes and utilities to facilitate the
definition of very simple, personal template languages.

The library provides a basic, regex-based substitution engine, which doesn't
recognize any particular syntax by itself; it's up to the user to provide it
with his own tag patterns as well as their optional, custom behaviour.

tie also provides simple tools to ease the definition of those custom tags,
and aims to allow for easy customisation or extension (either by proviing
callbacks or by subclassing the provided types).
